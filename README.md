# Smart-and-adaptive-quiz-game
this is the adaptive quiz game where the level varies accordingly
Objectives
- To develop an adaptive quiz game that adjusts difficulty based on user performance.
- To implement OOP principles like classes, inheritance, operator overloading, and templates in C++.
- To enhance student engagement through a fun and interactive quiz system.
- To incorporate file handling for storing questions and results.
- To implement a time-limited answering system that simulates real test conditions.
  Existing System
Traditional quiz games or systems generally follow:
- A fixed set of questions.
- No adaptation in difficulty level.
- Minimal interactivity and feedback.
- Manual score recording.

These systems fail to motivate learners and do not challenge students based on their capability level.
4 Proposed System
The proposed Smart Adaptive Quiz Game solves the drawbacks of the existing system by introducing:
- Adaptive difficulty (easy → medium → hard depending on performance).
- Time-bound answering (15 seconds per question).
- Randomized questions to avoid repetition.
- Automated scoring and result logging into a file.
- A scoreboard that displays performance analysis.
Description
The project is implemented using C++ programming language.
- Question Class: Handles storage and display of questions.
- Player Class: Stores player information and score (using operator overloading).
- Quiz Class: Manages the flow of the game, difficulty adjustment, and scoreboard.
- File Handling: Ensures persistent storage of questions and results.
- Timer System: Uses conio.h and windows.h to provide a 15-second answering time.

This system is primarily intended for educational purposes, enabling students to practice and evaluate themselves interactively and does the job.
